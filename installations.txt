Step 1) Upload the contents of the Files folder to your webserver.

	Upload the contents of the Files folder to your public_html folder:


Important: Make sure you have also uploaded the .htaccess file, select 'show hidden files' in your filemanager if you cannot see it.

Step 2) Login to the admin panel and update the site settings.

	Login to the admin panel on http://mysite.com/admin/ with username= admin and password= password and fill in your site url, YouTube api key and other details and click Update.
